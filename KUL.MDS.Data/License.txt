 This library is very loosely based on xylib library.

 xylib is a library for reading files that contain x-y data from powder
 diffraction, spectroscopy or other experimental methods.

 It is recommended to set LC_NUMERIC="C" (or other locale with the same 
 numeric format) before reading files.
 
 Usually, we first call load_file() to read file from disk. It stores 
 all data from the file in class DataSet. 
 DataSet contains a list of Blocks, each Blocks contains a list of Columns, 
 and each Column contains a list of values. 

 It may sound complex, but IMO it can't be made simpler.
 It's analogical to a spreadsheet. One OOCalc or Excel file (which 
 corresponds to xylib::DataSet) contains a number of sheets (Blocks), 
 but usually only one is used. We can view each sheet as a list of columns. 

 In xylib all columns in one block must have equal length. 
 Several filetypes always contain only one Block with two Columns.
 In this case we can take coordinates of the 15th point as:
    double x = get_block(0)->get_column(1)->get_value(14);
    double y = get_block(0)->get_column(2)->get_value(14);
 Note that blocks and points are numbered from 0, but columns are numbered
 from 1, because the column 0 returns index of point.
 All values are stored as floating-point numbers, even if they are integers
 in the file.
 DataSet and Block contain also MetaData, which is a string to string map.
